# Terminal Portfolio (Vue 3 + Vite)

An interactive portfolio/profile web app built with Vue 3 and Vite, styled to look and feel like a developer terminal. Type commands to explore about, experience, education, projects, npm packages, and tech skills.

## Features

- Terminal-style UI with blinking cursor and command history
- Type `help` to see all available commands
- Commands: `about`, `experience`, `education`, `projects`, `npm packages`, `skills`, `cls`/`clear` (clear terminal)
- Each command shows relevant info: personal intro, work experience, education, project list, npm packages, categorized tech skills
- Responsive, modern design using Tailwind CSS and Vue 3 `<script setup>`

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   ```
3. **Open your browser:**
   Visit [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (or the port shown in your terminal)
